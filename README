gdebi is a simple to tool install local deb files.

It will use apt to figure if the dependencies can be satified and
what additonal software is required. 

It needs a patched vte and the latest python-apt--mvo--0 to work.

It will need root to install the deb, it's probably best to have a
non-root bit to view the deb and a "install-mode" bit that is run
with gksudo (possible exit the non-root bit).
