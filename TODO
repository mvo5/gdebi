* add "--assume-yes" option
* add check for removal of essential packages
* add downgrade(?)
* rename to "debonair" ?
* install-progress: error reporting, conf-file prompts
* code cleanup
* basic description formating (summary, " ." lines)
* conflict/replace situation not handled correctly (refuses to do anything)

Longer term:
------------
* do the cache calculation stuff in the background (thread)
* support for something simialar like the n770 people (install user, 
  installed stuff goes to /var/lib/install). makes us much more secure,
  but less flexible
* support remote location of packages - gnomevfs vs urllib


Done:
-----
* deal with packages that conflict with their own provides 
  (e.g. C/P/R: ftp-server) [DONE]
