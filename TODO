* apt-progress: error reporting, conf-file prompts, media-change
* code cleanup
* better status support in gui: 
  - "Package is not installed"
  - "Package is installed and upgradable"
  - "Package is at the same version"
  - "Pkg on system is newer than deb"
* basic description formating (summary, " ." lines)
* don't give a "error: same version already installed" after
  installing something
* conflict/replace situation not handled correctly (refuses to do anything)

* give a gui-error when the archive can't be locked
* do the cache calculation stuff in the background o
* support for something simialar like the n770 people (install user, 
  installed stuff goes to /var/lib/install). makes us much more secure,
  but less flexible

Package that can't be handled:
* exim4 (when postfix is installed):
  wants to remove 8 pkgs, apt will only remove 1 (postfix)
