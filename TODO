* add downgrade(?)
* rename to "debonair" ?
* install-progress: error reporting, conf-file prompts
* code cleanup
* basic description formating (summary, " ." lines)
* conflict/replace situation not handled correctly (refuses to do anything)
* list translators in data/gdebi.glade

Longer term:
------------
* do the cache calculation stuff in the background (thread)
* support for something simialar like the n770 people (install user, 
  installed stuff goes to /var/lib/install). makes us much more secure,
  but less flexible
