* apt-progress: error reporting, conf-file prompts, media-change
* code cleanup
* better status support in gui: 
  - "Package is not installed"
  - "Package is installed and upgradable"
  - "Package is at the same version"
  - "Pkg on system is newer than deb"
* basic description formating (summary, " ." lines)
* check if virtual packages dependencies/conflicts work
  -> Conflicts on virutal pkg looks broken

Package that can't be handled:
* exim4 (when postfix is installed):
  wants to remove 8 pkgs, apt will only remove 1 (postfix)
